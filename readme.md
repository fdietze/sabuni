# Sabuni

Light Colorscheme for IntelliJ IDEA

## Goals

* Focused on Scala, Java, Dart and Kotlin
* Light with high contrast, useful for working with daylight or outside
* Semantic highlighting
    * Make mutability (currently only vars) visible
    * Distinguish usages of `class`, `trait`, `abstract class` and `object`
    * Mark implicit conversions
